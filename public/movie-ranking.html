<h1>The Best Movies of All Time According to Ayden</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>It's a classic. It has a great Story, great characters, great ending. This pick is pretty self-explanatory. </p>

<h3>The Wolf of Wall Street</h3>
<p>I loved this movie because it showcased the story of someone going from nothing to something, and the rewards and luxuries for people at the top. Though Jordan wasn't able to keep his empire, I still appriciated the process, and the comedy shwocased throughout the movie.</p>

<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>This movie is another classic. Quinten Tarentino did a great job with the casting and the variety of twists kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.</p>
